# Postnihilism

Nihilism has failed. A century of multiple genocides, workaholism, collapse of meaning, and late stage capitalism are all undergirded by nihilism. We are lonelier than ever, angrier than ever, and more divided than ever. It is time to move beyond nihilism. 

Postnihilism is the active and energy rejection of nihilism, the deliberate construction of a new narrative. To understand the problem, and chart the path forward, we need to identify the pattern, the system that is broken.
